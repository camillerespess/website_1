  <h1>St. Louis is undeniably an underrated city. Here's two reasons you should visit.</h1>
  <p>By Camille Respess</p>
  <p>Yes, it may be considered a flyover city. But St. Louis should actually be viewed as the treasure that it is. With the nation's best city park, winning sports teams, and toasted ravioli, the Gateway to the West should be on your travel bucket list. Using JavaScript, I learned how to make the images on the page interactive.</p>

    <h2> 1. Forest Park is reason enough to book a trip. </h2>
    <p>In St. Louis, you can spend the day exploring Forest Park. Fun fact: This park is larger than Central Park in New York City. Here, visitors are able to some of the nation's best museums -- and a zoo -- all for free. That's right. In St. Louis, these attractions are free. What's more, there's a plethora of history in Forest Park is it was the location of the 1904 World's Fair.</p>

    <h2> 2. And the obvious: The St. Louis Arch.</h2>
    <p>Also known as the Gateway to the west, the St. Louis Arch was built in 1965. For over 50 years,locals and tourists alike have flocked to the Arch grounds. The Arch is home to an unparallaled view of the Mississipi River. What's more, visitors can actually go inside the Arch and ride in an elevator to the top. Underneath the Arch lies a newly renovated museum. There's so much to take in at the St. Louis Arch, which is yet another reason to book a trip to the Gateway City.</p>
